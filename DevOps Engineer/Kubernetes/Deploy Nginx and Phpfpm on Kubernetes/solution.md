#### Deploy Nginx and Phpfpm on Kubernetes

1. Change directory to `/home/thor` on jump box,

```
thor@jump_host /$ cd /home/thor/
```

2. Now, create a config file for configmap and pod respectively,

```
thor@jump_host ~$ vi nginx-php-app.yaml
```
*Note: Check current directory for the config*

3. Use alias k as kubectl,

```
thor@jump_host ~$ alias k='kubectl'
```

4. Apply the config file, so it will create a configmap and pod resepctively,

```
thor@jump_host ~$ k create -f nginx-php-app.yaml
configmap/nginx-config created
pod/nginx-phpfpm created
```

5. Wait till both the containers are in running state.

```
thor@jump_host /$ kubectl get pods
NAME           READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-phpfpm   2/2     Running   0          45s
```

Note: You will see the response from the app 403 Forbidden which is ok as in document root, there is no file named index.php, etc.
For debugging you can ssh to container and check the document root and locally accessing application,

```
kubectl exec -it nginx-phpfpm -c nginx-container â€“ /bin/nash

curl localhost:8096

Similarly check with other container in the pod.
```

THank you.
